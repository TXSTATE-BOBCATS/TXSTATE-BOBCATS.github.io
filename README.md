Our group is displaying a flood map from a recent natural disaster.
We are interested in portraying data that shows the area of the affected area in terms of flood depth and precipitation. We would like to add multiple locations that were flooded to allow users to compare the data with the others on the map.
######Things to include in the web map:
- buffer around the affected area
- contouring lines for water depth
- density of the population of nearby neighborhoods
- specify location of chosen area
