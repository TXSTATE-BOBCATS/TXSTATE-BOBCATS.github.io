### Project Introduction
The objective of this project is to built web mapping application to inform the audience of the possible air pollution that occurred during and after the ITC Deer Park fire incident in March, 2019.

The study area is the ITC facility, which had a tank started burning on March 17, 2019. The officials then conduct a series of air monitoring plan to collect the concentration level of pollutants, including Benzene, VOCs, CO at multiple locations near the plant and across the greater Houston area. The data that we gathered was through credible sources including ESRI ArcGIS and websites of government organization such as TCEQ and EPA.

This web mapping application was built using [ArcGIS JavaScript API 4.13](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/). It will exhibit to the public a map showing background information of the fire incidence and the levels of the hazardous gases detected near to the facility, and give the users an opportunity to use ArcGIS widgets that will show their proximity to air monitoring locations where pollutants were detected.
